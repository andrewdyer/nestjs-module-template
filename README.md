## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x (as specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)) is required.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager for managing dependencies.
- **NestJS CLI**: Ensure your app is generated using [`@nestjs/cli`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) for best compatibility.

## Features

This template includes the following additional tools and configurations:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking and improved developer experience.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing, along with [`@nestjs/testing`](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing) for testing utilities.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting TypeScript code to maintain code quality.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for enforcing consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for Git hooks to automate tasks such as linting, formatting, and testing before commits.
