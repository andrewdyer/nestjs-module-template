## Introduction

This template provides a solid foundation for building **standalone and reusable NestJS modules**. Designed specifically for **NestJS v11 applications**, it ensures seamless integration, scalability, and consistency across multiple projects. By using this template, you can hit the ground running and save valuable time when creating reusable modules, as it includes pre-configured tools and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x (as specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)) is required.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager for managing dependencies.
- **NestJS CLI**: Ensure your app is generated using [`@nestjs/cli`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) for best compatibility.

## Features

This template includes the following additional tools and configurations:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking and improved developer experience.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing, along with [`@nestjs/testing`](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing) for testing utilities.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting TypeScript code to maintain code quality.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for enforcing consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for Git hooks to automate tasks such as linting, formatting, and testing before commits.
